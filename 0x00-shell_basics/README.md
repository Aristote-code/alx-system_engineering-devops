Each project directory contains a `README.md` file that explains the objective of the project and how to run the script.

## Getting started

To run the scripts in this directory, you will need to have a Linux terminal emulator installed on your machine, such as Bash, Zsh, or Fish. You can run the scripts using the following command:

```bash
./script-name
```

Make sure to make the script executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod u+x script-name
```

You can also run the scripts in a Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app alpine:latest sh /app/script-name
```

This command will mount the current directory into the container and run the script inside the container.
